# nullsafety

A new Flutter project to understand Null Safety in Flutter.

## Writing notes about Null Safety in Flutter.

#What happens when Null safety is set as default?
1. All variables cannot be null. Non-nullable variables cannot be assigned as null.
   >> This causes Compile errors. It means you cannot even run the code
2. Null check is not needed for non-nullable variable.
   >> This doesnt give compile error, but the program suggests to remove if statement.
3. variables "in Class" should be initialized as soon as it is declared.
   >> This also causes Compile error.

# How do we activate or deactivate null safety opt in flutter?
